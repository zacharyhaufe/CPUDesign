<h1>CPU Design</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I designed a simple CPU (central processing unit) that follows a "fetch-decode-execute" cycle. This cycle retrieves instructions from memory, decodes the instruction to determine the required operation, executes the operation, and then repeats the process.
